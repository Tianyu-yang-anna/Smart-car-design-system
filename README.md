# Smart-car-design-system
Smart car design system is a set in automotive electronics, control, pattern recognition, sensing technology, electronics, electrical, computer, machinery, and other multi-disciplinary creative design of science and technology, it is mainly composed of path identification, acquisition speed, Angle control and speed control module, the paper introduces the development of intelligent car Angle control and speed control with the results. And, this paper design a car speed - Angle coupling control based on neural network model, analyzes the basic control principle and characteristics of the car, put forward the model of overall scheme, finally use Python on the car of the program and relevant algorithm simulation and testing, the results show that the coupling control based on neural network model of the scheme is feasible, and has good control and operation effect.
